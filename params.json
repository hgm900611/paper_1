{"name":"Paper read summary for MapReduce","tagline":"","body":"This page includes my paper read summary for MapReduce. I will mainly talks about three important issues including:\r\n* **Job scheduling for minimizing the total response time**\r\n* **Data locality issue**\r\n* **Speculative Execution**\r\n\r\nFor each issue I will make two categories which are theoretical analysis based optimization and heuristic based algorithm  design. Hope you can get something useful from this summary.\r\n\r\n## Job Scheduling\r\n### Theoretical Analysis based:\r\n* * [Hyunseok Chang, Murali Kodialam, Ramana Rao Kompella, T. V. Lakshman, Myungjin Lee, Sarit Mukherjee, \"Scheduling in MapReduce-like Systems for Fast completion time,\" in Infocom 2011.](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=5935152&tag=1)\r\n* This paper seeks to optimize the total completion time of job running in the Mapreduce system. It decides the scheduling order of tasks on each processor. Moreover, this paper doesn't consider the dependency between map task and reduce tasks. A linear program is formulated to relax the original problem. It then outlines a combinatorial approach to solve the LP problem.\r\n\r\n* [F. Chen, M. Kodialam, and T. Lakshman, “Joint scheduling of processing\r\nand shuffle phases in MapReduce systems,” in Infocom 2012.](http://www.cse.psu.edu/~fachen/pubs/infocom12mr.pdf) \r\nActually this paper is the follow-up work of the above paper. To be more practical, it considers the dependency between map and reduce tasks. Moreover, it jointly optimize the job completion time by imposing the shuffle phase constraint. \r\n\r\n* [Jian Tan, Xiaoqiao Meng, Li Zhang, “Delay Tails in MapReduce Scheduling,” in SIGMETRICS 12,](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2254761) This paper focuses on the the starvation problem of small jobs under fair scheduler in MapReduce. The root reason of this problem is caused by launching the reduce tasks so early. To efficiently solve this issue and improve the job response performance, it presents a couple scheduler which assign the reduce tasks based on the progress of the map phase. The theoretical analysis here is very complicated. \r\n\r\n### Heuristic based:\r\n\r\n## Data locality \r\n\r\n\r\n## Speculative execution\r\n### Theoretical Analysis based: \r\n### Heuristic based:\r\n* [Qi Chen, Chen Liu, Zhen Xiao, \"Improving MapReduce Performance Using Smart Speculative Execution Strategy,\" in transactions of Computer Networks.](http://www.computer.org/csdl/trans/tc/preprint/06419699-abs.html)\r\n* [G.

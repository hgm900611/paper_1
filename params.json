{"name":"Paper read summary for MapReduce","tagline":"","body":"This page includes my paper read summary for MapReduce. I will mainly talks about three important issues including:\r\n* **Job scheduling for minimizing the total response time**\r\n* **Data locality issue**\r\n* **Speculative Execution**\r\n\r\nFor each issue I will make two categories which are theoretical analysis based optimization and heuristic based algorithm  design. Hope you can get something useful from this summary.\r\n\r\n### Job Scheduling\r\n* [Hyunseok Chang, Murali Kodianlam, \"Scheduling in MapReduce-like Systems for Fast completion time,\" in Infocom 2011.](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=5935152&tag=1)\r\nThis paper seeks to optimize the total completion time of job running in the Mapreduce system.\r\n\r\n### Data locality \r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Speculative execution\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?

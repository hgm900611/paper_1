<p>This page includes my paper read summary for MapReduce. I will mainly talks about three important issues including:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Job scheduling for minimizing the total response time</strong></li>
<li><strong>Data locality issue</strong></li>
<li><strong>Speculative Execution</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>For each issue I will make two categories which are theoretical analysis based optimization and heuristic based algorithm  design. Hope you can get something useful from this summary.</p>

map-reduce and flow-shops,” in SPAA 2011.</a> This paper seeks to minimize the <em>flowtime</em> of jobs in MapReduce which is motivated from the two-stage flow shop problem. The tasks to machine mapping is unknown and needs to be determined such that the total <em>flowtime</em> is minimized. </p>

<pre><code>In our following research, we can consider to optimize the job scheduling in a heterogeneous environment where the machines are not identical.

Lakshman, Myungjin Lee, Sarit Mukherjee, "Scheduling in MapReduce-like Systems for Fast completion time," in Infocom 2011.</a> This paper seeks to optimize the total completion time of job running in the Mapreduce system. It decides the scheduling order of tasks on each processor. Moreover, this paper doesn't consider the dependency between map task and reduce tasks. A linear program is formulated to relax the original problem. It then outlines a combinatorial approach to solve the LP problem.</p></li>

and shuffle phases in MapReduce systems,” in Infocom 2012.</a> 
Actually this paper is the follow-up work of the above paper. To be more practical, it considers the dependency between map and reduce tasks. Moreover, it jointly optimize the job completion time by imposing the shuffle phase constraint. </p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2254761">Jian Tan, Xiaoqiao Meng, Li Zhang, “Delay Tails in MapReduce Scheduling,” in SIGMETRICS 2012.</a> This paper focuses on the the starvation problem of small jobs under fair scheduler in MapReduce. The root reason of this problem is caused by launching the reduce tasks so early. To efficiently solve this issue and improve the job response performance, it presents a couple scheduler which assign the reduce tasks based on the progress of the map phase. The theoretical analysis here is very complicated. </p></li>

This paper is the first work to write down the formulation of mapreduce job scheduling including both map and reduce phases. There is no distinguish between map and reduce slots here. It uses adopts the knowledge in probability to prove that any work-conserving scheduler can achieves a constant efficiency ratio (not competitive ratio). Moreover, this paper presents the ASRPT algorithm which is inspired from the famous SRPT (Shortest remaining time first) algorithm and bound the competitive ratio to be 2.</p></li>

Tan, "Joint optimization of overlapping phases in MapReduce," in IFIP 2013.</a>. This is the first work to consider the overlapping of map phase and shuffle phase so far. A nice formulation is also written down here. Hover, even the offline case with batch arrival is shown to be NP-Complete. It then presents the MaxSRPT ans SpiltSRPT algorithm which are complementary to solve schedule the jobs.</p></li>

data locality constraint,” in ISIT 2012.</a> This paper presents the peeling algorithm and adopts the mean-field equations to analyze the evolution (I cannot understand it well). However, it makes an impractical assumption which is that all the tasks with data locality on the machine can be finished in a time slot with probability <em>p</em> while the tasks without data locality can only be finished with probability <em>q</em> and <strong>p &gt; q</strong>. Also the theoretical here is very complex. </p></li>

Zhang, "Map Task Scheduling in MapReduce with Data Locality: Throughput and Heavy-Traffic Optimality," in Infocom 2013.</a>. This paper makes the same assumption as the above paper presented in ISIT 2012. Its task scheduling algorithm includes two aspects which are<code>Routing</code> and <code>Scheduling</code>. The purpose of routing is to keep load balancing for all the machines. Also scheduling process makes a very simple decision based on the length of queues. It adopts the Lyapunov function to prove the stability of the algorithm. The analysis here is also nontrivial. </p></li>

Tan, X. Meng, L. Zhang, "Improving ReduceTask Data Locality for Sequential MapReduce Jobs," in Infocom 2013.</a> This is the first paper to analyze the data locality issue for reduce tasks with theoretical analysis. Actually, the model here is quite simple, the objective is only to minimize the data transfer cost in shuffle phase with proper reduce task placement. The data transfer cost gives a very good angle for analyzing data locality issue.  </p></li>
